Aishu wants to develop a program to calculate the total viewing time for a movie marathon of the Deadpool series based on the number of movies and the frequency of breaks.



She is provided with the following information:

Each movie in the series has a fixed duration of 45 minutes.
After watching a certain number of movies, there is a break of 15 minutes.


Assist Aishu in creating a program that accepts input for the total number of movies in the series and the number of movies watched before a break. Calculate and output the total viewing time required to watch the entire series, including the breaks. Use the conditional operator for the same.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the total number of movies in the series.

The second line consists of an integer k, representing the number of movies watched before a break.

Output format :
The output displays an integer representing the total viewing time required to watch the entire series, including the breaks, in minutes.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 20

1 ≤ k ≤ 10

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
2
Output 1 :
255 minutes
Input 2 :
4
3
Output 2 :
195 minutes
Input 3 :
13
5
Output 3 :
615 minutes
