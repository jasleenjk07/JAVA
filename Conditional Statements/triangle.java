//Maria is building a program to classify triangles based on side lengths. The program should take three integer inputs and identify if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or right-angled. Help Maria create this classification program.



//Note: Equilateral - all sides equal; Isosceles - two sides equal; Scalene - all sides different. The square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides, for a triangle to be right-angled.

//Input format :
//The input consists of three space-separated integers, representing the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

//Output format :
//The output should display the type of triangle ("equilateral", "isosceles" or "scalene").

//"The triangle is <type>"

//If it is right-angled

//"The triangle is also right-angled"



//Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

//Code constraints :
//The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

//1 ≤ sides of triangle ≤ 100

//Sample test cases :
//Input 1 :
//4 13 15
//Output 1 :
//The triangle is scalene
//Input 2 :
//5 5 7
//Output 2 :
//The triangle is isosceles
//Input 3 :
//3 3 3
//Output 3 :
//The triangle is equilateral
//Input 4 :
//5 12 13
//Output 4 :
//The triangle is scalene
//The triangle is also right-angled
